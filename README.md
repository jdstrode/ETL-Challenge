### Intention of the Repository

This Repository has been made to summit the project assignment for our Data Science Bootcamp at Northwestern University

ETL PROJECT

Students: Jorge Daniel Atuesta, John Strode & John Cass

May, 2021

### Inside of this repository

In this repository, the reader will encounter our solution to the ETL project. The repository is organized in folders and a README.md (The file you are currently reading). Here is the list of the folders and their contents so you can navigate through them.

I hope you find our work not only to be complete but to display all the knowledge learned throughout this portion of the Data Science Bootcamp at Northwestern University.

1. **Images**: Inside this folder, you will find the images used to create this README.MD file. *You can skip this folder if you want*.
2. **ETL**: Inside this folder, you will have the chance to access our code for the assignment and all the output data. I encourage you to take a look inside as you will find the solution to the project. Here are what's inside:

* *Resources*: You will see the CSV files that we used for the project.
* *data_etl*: This is the final data that was created on our data base.
* *queries*: This contains the queries that we used for our project in Postgress

3. **README.md**: it's the current file you are reading. We strongly suggest navigating through it and look at the project's objective solution and analysis.

I hope you find our work not only to be complete but to display all the knowledge learned throughout this portion of the Data Science Bootcamp at Northwestern University.

### Project's Aim

Happiness, a word that evokes several emotions in humans. It's that feeling most of us are seeking. But what if there is a shortcut to experiencing this emotion. In this project, we were able to look at what country is the happiest and what the total population is per country. Yes, that's right, the number of people around you might be a predominant factor in the level of happiness one experiences, or so we think.

To do this, we pulled two data sets, one describing each country's happiness level and the other that contained the population amount per country. We then merged these two data sets to create on master data set on our database for future analysis.

#### Project's Challanges

1. Find two seperate data sets that have a relationship
2. Read seperatly the data sets.
3. Individually clean the data
   1. Looking for N/A
   2. Looking for duplicated values
   3. Dropping unwanted columns
4. Creating new data frames
5. Pushing the data sets to our data base
6. Reading the data on out data base
7. Joining both data sets to create one data set with both sets of information

#### Project's out come
